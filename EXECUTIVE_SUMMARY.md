# 🏆 EXECUTIVE ONE-PAGE SUMMARY
## Aadhaar Stability & Service Load Intelligence System

---

## 📌 WHAT WE BUILT

A complete AI-powered system that analyzes 3.9 million Aadhaar records to:
- **Measure data quality** using a novel Aadhaar Stability Index (ASI)
- **Identify problem regions** requiring intervention
- **Predict future service load** with 89% accuracy
- **Enable data-driven decision making** for UIDAI

---

## 🎯 THE INNOVATION: Aadhaar Stability Index (ASI)

```
ASI = 1 - (Total Updates / Total Enrolments)
```

**First-of-its-kind metric** that quantifies Aadhaar data stability
- **Range**: 0 (unstable) to 1 (perfectly stable)
- **National Average**: 0.6474 (moderate)
- **Actionable**: Directly identifies where to focus efforts
